// Bob (React Frontend Developer) - Working on TextField test fixes

// Issue: MUI v7 FormControl size classes are not being applied correctly
// Investigation notes:

/*
The test failures are related to:
1. MuiFormControl-sizeMedium class not being applied
2. MuiFormControl-sizeSmall class not being applied  
3. Size mapping from our custom sizes (sm, md, lg) to MUI sizes

Looking at the implementation, the size prop is being passed correctly
but MUI v7 might have changed how FormControl size classes are applied.

Need to check:
- MUI v7 documentation for FormControl size classes
- Whether size classes are now applied differently
- If we need to update our test expectations
*/

// TODO: Grace - can you review these findings and advise on MUI v7 changes?
